nx serve api = run Api app
nx serve auth-project = run AuthProject app
nx dep-graph = show WorkSpace Graph

nx affected:apps =  The affected:apps looks at what you have changed and uses the project graph to figure out which apps are affected by this change.

nx affected:test to retest only the projects affected by the change.
